This is a fork of the demoPuppy which was originally designed by K. Dermitzakis (dermitza)[https://github.com/dermitza].

New models were added which are compatible with the original models. They include
- Servo holders for standard size servos
- Flexible legs which can be printed in one piece with flexible material
- A one piece body unit which has the holes to hold a Arduino Mega
- A holder for the IMU "MPU6050" which fits to the one piece body

The files are not jet added to the repository and will follow in the next days.
