This is a fork of the demoPuppy which was originally designed by K. Dermitzakis [dermitza](https://github.com/dermitza). The original files are described on his [website](https://dermitza.github.io/demoPuppy/).

New models were added which are compatible with the original models. They include
- Servo holders for cheap Carson CS-3 standard size servos
- Flexible legs which can be printed in one piece with flexible material
- A one piece body unit which has the holes to hold a Arduino Mega
- A holder for the IMU "MPU6050" which fits to the one piece body

All included files can be 3D printed. We used an Ultimaker2.

The new models are included in the V5 pack. This configuration is shown in the following image:
