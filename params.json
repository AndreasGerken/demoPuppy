The robot is designed to feature interchangeable legs, actuators and spine and to be used with an [Arduino Uno](http://arduino.cc/en/Main/ArduinoBoardUno) micro-controller.\r\n\r\nThe body has been designed with input from [Juan Pablo Carbajal](http://reslab.elis.ugent.be/drjpi). The legs are a modified - 3D-printer optimized - version of a CNC-milled design from Emanuel Benker.\r\n\r\nIt comes in two configurations, a rigid and a flexible spine assembly. The flexible spine assembly is to be used with a 3mm diameter bungee elastic cord and a cam cleat (source files included). The spine stiffness can be varied by adjusting the bungee cord tension. Torsion springs are used to keep the cleat in place.\r\n\r\n## Revisions & Issues\r\n\r\n### rev 0.1\r\n\r\nRev 0.1 is the first published revision.\r\n\r\n## Files\r\n\r\n* Solidworks source files (.sldprt, .sldasm)\r\n* stl files (.stl)\r\n\r\n## License\r\n\r\nAll files are released under the [CC BY-SA 3.0](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/) licence.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
